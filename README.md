Tash v2.1 - The All-in-One MITM Powerhouse  <!-- You can upload the ASCII art as an image and link it here for better display -->>> This tool was made from my heart by Taha sh <<Tash is a powerful, user-friendly, and all-in-one command-line tool designed for Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. It leverages the robust bettercap engine to provide a seamless experience for network reconnaissance and penetration testing, while hiding the complexity behind a simple, interactive menu.This tool is created for educational purposes, to help security enthusiasts and ethical hackers understand the mechanics and dangers of MITM attacks in a controlled environment.🌟 FeaturesSimple & Interactive Menu: No complex commands to remember. Just choose an option and launch the attack.•Intelligent Network Scanner: Automatically discovers your network range and performs a detailed scan on all connected devices, providing you with IP addresses, MAC addresses, OS guesses, and open ports.•Powered by Bettercap: Utilizes the industry-standard •bettercap engine for all attack phases, ensuring stability and power.Advanced SSL Stripping: Automatically enables •sslstrip+ to bypass HSTS preloaded policies, increasing the chances of capturing credentials on modern websites (relies on user interaction).Automatic Credential Harvesting: The built-in sniffer automatically detects and displays captured usernames and passwords directly on your terminal in real-time. No need to monitor log files!•Targeted & Network-Wide Attacks: Choose to launch a precise attack against a single target or unleash a full-scale assault on the entire network.•Safe & Clean Exit: A built-in cleanup function ensures that all network configurations are restored to normal upon exiting the tool, preventing lasting disruptions.•🛠️ How It WorksTash automates the entire MITM attack sequence:Reconnaissance: Probes the network to identify live hosts.1.ARP Spoofing: Poisons the ARP cache of the target(s) and the gateway to redirect all their traffic through your machine.2.HTTPS Proxy & SSL Stripping: Sets up an HTTPS proxy that attempts to downgrade HTTPS connections to HTTP. For HSTS-protected sites, it attempts to bypass the protection by serving a fake certificate.3.Packet Sniffing: Sniffs the redirected traffic, automatically parsing it to identify and display sensitive data like credentials.4.📋 RequirementsTashBefore running , you need to have the following tools installed on your system (Debian/Ubuntu based):bettercap: The core engine for the attack.•nmap: Used for the detailed network scanning.•sudo apt update
sudo apt install bettercap nmap
